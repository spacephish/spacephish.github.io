# Implementation

We submitted an Artifact of our paper to the ACSAC Artifact Evaluation, and we received a "Reusable" badge. Moreover, during the evaluation, the reviewers were able to replicate the results achieved in our paper. 

We publicly release all the material (documentation, results and source-code) of our Artifact, which can be found in the dedicated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hihey54/acsac22_spacephish).
